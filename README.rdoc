= Frank IO
Frank IO is an online command based personal data logger.  It's expandable with different 'modules', each of which can define multiple commands.

It's still in it's early stages, but soon will be able to output reports on recorded data and possibly setup reminders.

== Commands

=== Activity Logger
Start activities by typing:
    activity gym start

Stop activities by typing:
    activity gym stop

Where 'gym' can be any activity you like.

To view a list of all logged activities just type:
    activity

=== Data Recorder
The data recorder module provides the record command which you can use to save any type of data you like.

To record some data type:
    record weight 172

To view a report of a particular type of data type:
    record weight
	
Where weight is whatever data key you like.

To view a list of all recorded data keys type:
    record

== Writing Modules
Modules can be added by adding a file in the modules folder which defines a class which is named the same as the file.  Any method in that class not prefixed with "_" defines a command by the same name.
